\chapter{Introduction}

A \emph{Centralized System} is one in which a the core functionality of the
system is dictated by a single body that single-handedly determines the use and
behavior of the system. Any privacy guarantees are at the sole discretion of the
system.

Users of Centralized Systems have no inherent guarantee of \emph{privacy} of
their data. How their data is collected and used is at the sole discretion of
the service. Services often offer vague claims as to their privacy guarantees
for users.

This thesis presents multiple avenues of research providing mechanisms for
Centralized Systems to offer services built on privacy. These services are built
upon privacy proofs which guarantee they limit information shared between users
and the services and have the smallest possible surface area allowing these
Centralized Systems to provably guarantee their services are fully enabling user
privacy.

In order to develop these tools which guarantee user privacy there must be a
basis of what information is necessary for a service to function as well as how
potential bad acting Centralized Systems abuse the service they offer to
restrict access to the content of the service they offer.

Basically the intro of poc

\section{Metadata Privacy}
Basically the intro to signal

\section{Measurement of censorship in existing systems}
Basically the intro to Mind the IP Gap

\section{Rest of this Thesis}
In this thesis we provide three projects geared towards enhancing Privacy in
Centralized Systems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Proof of Censorship --- We showcase content provider censorship and
    how a service dedicated to not censoring its users can implement a service
    with privacy guarantees that users content will not be removed or altered by
    the service.
    \item Improving Signal's Sealed Sender --- We build on Signal's Sealed
    Sender which promises its users the privacy of not knowing which user is
    messaging which users but ultimately is vulnerable to a simple Statistical
    Disclosure Attack allowing Signal (if compelled or malicious) to determine
    who a user is messaging. This work provides a provably private mechanism to
    ensure any centralized messaging service can offer its service without
    learning metadata information about which users are messaging each other.
    \item Mind the IP Gap --- We measure how countries censor access to the
    internet through DNS resolution over the IPv4 and IPv6 internet allowing
    future work to implement systems allow censored citizens to circumvent
    countries DNS censorship techniques.
