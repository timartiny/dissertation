	The vast majority of online services are run using a Centralized
	infrastructure. The Centralized nature of these services allow for the
	convenience of a uniform experience for all clients. This also requires
	users be completely at the whim of the service provider. Companies often
	offer a vague promise of security and privacy of the data collected from
	their users that the Users cannot verify themselves.

	This dissertation works to develop technologies that allow online services
	such as content providers and secure end-to-end encrypted messengers to
	offer their core functionality with minimal user information allowing
	services \emph{actually} geared towards privacy to provably have client's
	privacy be a core functionality of their service. A service that doesn't
	have access to client data cannot abuse or leak it.

	In order to develop these technologies a fundamental understanding of what
	client information is necessary for the service to function is required.
	This dissertation also examines the DNS system in over 100 countries to
	learn how countries censor access to content at the DNS level and propose
	methodologies to circumvent this violation of citizen privacy.
