	The vast majority of online services are run using a centralized
	infrastructure. The centralized nature of these services allow the provider
	to have absolute control over the content as well as any profit generated by
	that content. Centralized services often have servers distributed across the
	world for user reliability, though they function as centralized systems:
	their functionality is identical across their network and the data they
	collect is available to the service as a whole, not only the server a user
	interacts with. Users of these services, and the data they generate, are
	completely at the whim of the provider; companies often offer vague promises
	of security and privacy of the data collected from their users which the
	users cannot verify themselves. Moving these services to a decentralized
	system (where each server acts independently of others) could address these
	issues but decentralized systems often face severe scalability issues as
	well as having cumbersome requirements on users such as needing specialized
	software to access the service.

    This dissertation demonstrates that user privacy can be inherently built in
    to centralized systems using cryptographic protocols. Centralized systems
    can offer their services with minimal user information allowing services
    \emph{actually} geared towards privacy to have user's privacy be a core
    functionality of their service. A service that doesn't have access to users
    data cannot abuse or leak it.

    \emph{Proof of Censorship} utilizes Private Information Retrieval to enable
    content providers (such as Twitter) to guarantee they do not censor content,
    protecting it from modification and removal. \emph{Improving Signal's Sealed
    Sender} builds on Signal's Sealed Sender, a protocol that obscures the
    sender of encrypted messages, this work advances it by guaranteeing that
    privacy cryptographically using blind RSA signatures. \emph{Mind the IP Gap}
    measures how countries utilize their centralized censorship apparatus to
    restrict content to users through DNS manipulation.
