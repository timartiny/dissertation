\section{Solutions}\label{sec:signal-solution}
We now present three protocols that follow the security definition from
\cref{sec:signal-secdef} and, in particular, prevent the attacks presented in \cref{sec:signal-attack}.  We first outline a {\em one-way} sealed sender conversation in \cref{sec:signal-levelonesolution}, in which the initiator of the conversation remains anonymous.  We prove that our construction meets the definition presented in \cref{sec:signal-apxdefinitions}.   In \cref{sec:signal-leveltwosolution}, we extend this protocol to give better privacy to the receiver using a {\em two-way} sealed sender conversation.  Finally, in \cref{sec:signal-levelthreesolution}, we address denial of service attacks that malicious users could launch against the server. 

\medskip \noindent
\textbf{Overview of Solutions.} Our key observation is that the attack described in \cref{sec:signal-attack} is only possible because both users in a conversation are sending messages to the other's long-term identity.  Over time, these messages can be correlated, revealing the identities of the users.
On the other hand, if {\em anonymous} and {\em ephemeral} identities are used instead, then user's true identities can remain hidden.  However, anonymous identities lead to a bootstrapping problem: {\em how do users initiate and authenticate a conversation if they are using fresh, pseudonyms?} 

In a {\em one-way sealed sender conversations}, the identity of one side
of the conversation is leaked, namely the initial message receiver, in
order to solve this bootstrapping problem. This closely models the
situation of a whistle-blower, where the informant wishes to stay
anonymous, but the reporter receiving the information can be public. At
a high level, the initiator of the conversation begins by creating a
fresh, anonymous identity and then sends this identity to a receiver via
a normal sealed sender message (thus solving the bootstrapping problem).
The conversation proceeds with the initiator of the conversation sending
messages to the receiver using sealed sender (one way), and the
conversation receiver sending replies to the initiator's anonymous
identity. Importantly, the identity of the initiator is never leaked, as
no messages exchanged in the conversation contain that person's long-term
identity.  We prove that out protocol securely realizes the definition
of sealed sender conversations presented in
\cref{sec:signal-apxdefinitions}. 

A straightforward extension is to move towards {\em two-way sealed
sender conversations} where both parties use anonymous identities. This solution is described
in \cref{sec:signal-leveltwosolution}. When an initiator
starts a conversation as described above, the receiver
also creates a new anonymous identity and sends it via sealed sender back to the
conversation initiator. This protocol offers a single opportunity to
link the receiver to their new, anonymous identity (by correlating the
timing of the received message and the registering of a new public key),
but, as we have shown, network noise makes it difficult to re-identify
users with only a single event. Even in the unlikely case that
the conversation receiver is
linked to their long-term identity, we show that the conversation initiator
remains anonymous.

Both protocols place the service provider at risk of denial of service
attacks, and so in \cref{sec:signal-levelthreesolution}, we aim to
limit the power of users to arbitrarily register anonymous identities.
Allowing users to create unlimited anonymous identities would lead to
strain on the service provider if there is no way to differentiate
between legitimate anonymous identities and malicious ones. To prevent
these attacks, users are each given a limited number of anonymous
credentials that they can ``spend'' to register anonymous keys,
reminiscent of the earliest e-cash systems \cite{C:Chaum82}.  These
credentials can be validated by the service provider to ensure that a
legitimate user is requesting an anonymous identity without revealing
that user's identity. We use blind signatures to implement our anonymous
credentials.  We evaluate the practicality of this approach in
\cref{sec:signal-impl} and show that it could be deployed cheaply for
either one-way or two-way sealed sender conversations.


For simplicity, we assume that communicating users have already exchanged delivery tokens.  Any protections derived from these delivery tokens can be added to the following protocols in a straightforward manner.  Additionally, we assume users connect to the service provider via an anonymous channel, e.g., Tor or Orbot.

% that
% Alice uses a new anonymous identity in her conversation
% with Bob instead of her own, public identity.
% One can think of this ephemeral identity as a mailbox that is opened
% anonymously in a delivery center. Bob's messages back to Alice can
% then be addressed to this mailbox without revealing Alice's identity.

% Note that only one party in a two-way conversation (Alice, in our story)
% uses an anonymous mailbox; the other party (Bob) uses his public
% mailbox. This is a natural extension of the existing sealed sender
% protocol upon which our solution is based, which reveals the recipient
% of each message but not its sender. Our solution extends this idea of
% single-sided privacy from the level of individual messages (which the
% sealed sender protocol provides) to the level of multiple-message
% conversations (which our attack demonstrates sealed sender alone does
% not provide).

% When beginning a new conversation with Bob, Alice first creates a new
% ephemeral identity, and this ``return address'' is included with her
% sealed-sender message to Bob. When Bob replies (either with a delivery
% receipt, read receipt, or an actual response), he sends a sealed-sender
% message to the anonymous mailbox address that Alice sent him.
% In this way, even a powerful attacker who can use timing to connect
% messages and responses will only see that Bob is in a conversation with
% some anonymous mailbox, without any possibility of learning Alice's
% identity.

% Like in the sealed sender protocol itself, the main technical challenge
% in our solution is preventing the abuse that anonymity would otherwise
% enable; that is, preventing users from registering too many anonymous
% mailboxes.
% We limit the number of mailboxes per user, without compromising
% anonymity, by using anonymous credentials
% implemented with blind signatures.  Each user is issued a fixed number of anonymous
% credentials, each of which can be swapped for an active mailbox.  Once
% that mailbox is no longer needed, it can be closed and the user can be issued a fresh
% anonymous credential, all without the possibility of linking any user to
% any anonymous mailbox.


\subsection{Preliminaries}

\noindent
\textbf{Sealed Sender}
We assume that the service provider implements the sealed sender
mechanism described in \cref{ssec:signal-signal}.  Specifically, we assume that a client can generate a public/private key
pair and publish their public key as an address registered with the
service. If the server permits it through some verification process, the
server will allow messages to be sent to that public key without a sender.

More formally, we assume that the system has a sealed sender encryption scheme $\sealedsenderencryptionscheme$.  While Signal does not give a proof of security for the scheme it uses, for our constructions we will assume that $\sealedsenderencryptionscheme$ is a signcryption scheme that satisfies ciphertext anonymity \cite{PKC:LibQui04} and adopt the notation presented in \cite{ACISP:WMAS13} for its algorithms\footnote{We note that ciphertext anonymity is actually a stronger primitive than required, as there is no need for receiver anonymity.}. We say a sealed sender encryption scheme $\sealedsenderencryptionscheme$ is a set of three algorithms:
% $(\sealedsenderencryptiongen, \sealedsenderencryptionenc, \sealedsenderencryptiondec, \sealedsenderencryptionverify)$ defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item $\sealedsenderencryptiongen(1^\secparam) \rightarrow (\pk, \sk)$ generates a public/private key pair.

  \item $\sealedsenderencryptionenc(m, \sk_s, \pk_r) \rightarrow c$
  takes in a message $m$, the sender's secret key $\sk_s$ and the
  receiver's public key $\pk_r$, and outputs a ciphertext $c$

  \item $\sealedsenderencryptionvdec(\sk_r, c) \rightarrow \{
  (m,\pk_s), \bot \}$ takes in the receiver's private key $\sk_r$ and
  a ciphertext $c$ and either outputs a message $m$,and the public key of the sender $\pk_s$,
  or returns the error symbol $\bot$.
  (Note that this actually constitutes decryption followed by verification
  in the notation of \cite{ACISP:WMAS13}, returning $\bot$ when either step fails.)

%   \item $\sealedsenderencryptiondec(\sk_r, c) \rightarrow \{
%   (m,x,\pk_s), \bot \}$ takes in the receiver's private key $\sk_r$ and
%   a ciphertext $c$ and either outputs a message $m$, some additional
%   information $x$, and the public key of the sender $\pk_s$, or returns the error symbol $\bot$. 
% 
%   \item $\sealedsenderencryptionverify(m,x,\pk_s) \rightarrow \bin$
%   takes in the output of a decryption and verifies if it is correct.
\end{itemize}
Formal security definitions are given in \cite{ACISP:WMAS13}.  In short, the scheme satisfies (1) message indistinguishability, (2) unforgeability, and (3) ciphertext anonymity, meaning the ciphertext reveals nothing about the sender or receiver. 


% \paragraph*{Delivery Token.} Additionally, we assume that there is some sealed sender authentication mechanism $\sealedsenderauthscheme = (\sealedsenderauthschemegenerate, \sealedsenderauthschemeauth, \sealedsenderauthschemeverify)$ that allows a sender to prove that they are allowed to send a sealed sender message to a specific receiver.  We require that the output of $\sealedsenderauthschemeauth$ does not reveal the identity of the sender.  This scheme replicates the delivery tokens in Signal (see Section \ref{}).

\subsection{Blind Signature Performance} % timing, about this implementation (ripping parts out from more complicated protocols)
\label{sec:signal-impl}

To test the feasibility of using blind signatures, we implemented the
protocols in \cref{sec:signal-levelthreesolution} for a single client and
server. This represents the \emph{cryptographic overhead} of applying
our solution, as the remainder (sending and receiving messages,
registering keys) are services already provided by Signal.
%We now test the feasibility of using blind signatures to limit the number of anonymous mailboxes that can be opened by users.  We do this by implementing a server that runs the protocols specified in Section~\ref{sec:levelthreesolution}.  These protocols are the overhead required to run the solutions we have described, as sending and receiving messages and authenticating clients are already implemented.

  \label{tbl:signal-timing_results}
\end{table}


The networking for both the client and server are written in
Python, with the Django web framework \cite{django} on the server.
Starting with the code provided in \cite{blind_rsa_old_code}, we
implement an RSA-2048 blind signature \cite{C:Chaum82} library in Java that can be called via RPC. Although RSA ciphertexts are large, they are very fast
to compute on modern hardware.%  The Python code, both on the client and
%server side, uses this RPC interface to blind, sign, unblind, and verify
%signatures.  We use this RPC interface to ensure that the JVM can be
%initialized before execution and long-term keys can be loaded.

We evaluated our implementation by running the server on an AWS instance
with 2 Intel Xeon processors and 4 GB of RAM.  The client was running on
a consumer-grade laptop, with a 2.5 GHz Intel i7 with 16 GB of RAM,
located in the same region as the AWS server.
%Our client and server were both located on the same coast of the United States.
We report the timing results in \cref{tbl:signal-timing_results} for each
protocol.
%, divided into three categories.  First, we report the time it takes to generate the ephemeral key material for the sealed sender encryption scheme ({\bf Get Signed Mailbox Key} Step 2), in this case an
% ECDSA key.  Second, we report how long it takes for the client to blind the public key and interactively get a valid signature ({\bf Get Signed Mailbox Key} Step 3-5).  Finally, we report the time it takes to open a new mailbox, including verifying the signature ({\bf Open a mailbox}).
To better isolate the overhead from network delay, we also report the
execution time when server and client are running locally on the same
machine.

Importantly, ECDSA KeyGen can be run in the background of the client,
long before the interactive phase of the protocol starts.  For maximum
security, a user may close an old mailbox and get a new signed key (with the same anonymous connection), and then
open a new mailbox with each message that they send.  This incurs an
overhead of less that 100ms, even including network delay.  The communication overhead of running this 
full protocol is less that 1KB, constituting 3 RSA-2048 ciphertexts and 1 ECDSA public key.

\subsection{Deployment Considerations}
\label{sec:signal-deployment}

\medskip \noindent
\textbf{Key Rolling.}\label{ssec:signal-keyrolling}
It is critical that the server maintain a
database of ephemeral identities previously registered on the system
in order to check for re-use of old ephemeral identities.
% If this list is not properly maintained, a user can reuse old 
% ephemeral identities after they have been exchanged for a fresh
% identity in the mailbox closing subroutine.  This would, in effect,
% give users an unlimited number of valid ephemeral identities, 
% undermining the intended abuse prevention goal.
Note that to 
prevent reuse, this database must be maintained for as long as the
identities are valid and grows with the number of mailboxes, not the
number of users.

We suggest that Signal update their mailbox signing key at regular
intervals, perhaps each day, and leave two or three keys valid for overlapping
periods of time to avoid interruptions in service.
Because the validity of a signed
mailbox key is tied to the signing key, each update allows the server to
``forget'' all the keys
that it saw under the old signing keys as they cannot be reused.
% rolling the valid signing
% keys purges the validity of all older, signed ephemeral identities.
% Importantly, this also allows the server to ``forget'' all the keys

% Because Signal is an international service, rolling at a particular
% time each day may cause logistical problems with certain parts of
% the globe.
% For instance, rolling keys during the busiest time of
% the day may cause increased traffic at incontinent times.u
% Therefore,
% we also suggest that signing keys could be valid for overlapping 
% periods of time, giving users flexibility.  The only added
% complication is that a fresh ephemeral identity generated when
% closing a mailbox must be signed with the signing key used to sign
% the original mailbox identity.

\medskip \noindent
\textbf{Mailbox Opening.}
It is important that users perform {\bf Get signed mailbox key} (where Signal
learns a user's identify) and {\bf Open a mailbox} in an uncorrelated way.
Otherwise, Signal could link the two and identify the anonymous mailbox.
We recommend performing {\bf Get signed mailbox key} at regular intervals (e.g.
the same time each day), but careful consideration must be taken for users
that are offline during their usual time. Users should not come online and
perform both operations immediately if sending to a new conversation. To avoid this,
clients should maintain a small batch of extra signed mailbox keys for new
conversations.
%and refresh these at random intervals uncorrelated with their use.


\medskip \noindent
\textbf{Cost Overhead.}
We analyze the worst case cost of scaling our protocol. We generously assume that 10 million anonymous mailboxes will be opened every day.
%, and compute the costs associated with this many messages.
The server's part of opening these mailboxes constitutes calls to 
\bsverify and \bssign and a database query (to check for repeated identities).
In our experiments, the
two blind signature operations, including the Django networking
interface, took a cumulative .014 seconds.  Using AWS Lambda, supporting 
10 million messages each day would cost approximately \$10 per month.  
We estimate that doing 10 million reads and writes a day to a DynamoDB database
would cost approximately \$20 per month, using AWS's reserved capacity pricing.

Using the key rolling scheme described above, the database contains
at most the number of messages delivered in a day times the number
of simultaneously valid keys. At 10 million messages each time with a
two overlapping valid keys, this means the database would contain at most 20 million
ephemeral identities.  Assuming  256-bit identity
values, the entire database would never exceed a few GB of data.
%AWS charges \$0.25 to store a GB of data each month.
Therefore, we conservatively estimate that the
marginal cost of supporting our protocol for 10 million ephemeral identities per day
would be under \$40 per month.  We note our analysis does not consider the personnel cost associated with
developing or maintaining this infrastructure. Ideally, this would be
amortized along with Signal's existing reliability and support infrastructure.
% and given the relatively simple design change is unlikely to create significant
% additional burden.
